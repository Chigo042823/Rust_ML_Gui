This is a simple GUI that helps visualize the training process of Machine Learning Models
It uses pre-defined displays called widgets, these widgets let you see multiple things like your networks architecture, cost graph, output graph, or output image. 
You can customize the layout as well whether you want to stack your networks architecture on top of your cost graph or have them side by side, etc.
Will properly document soon...
